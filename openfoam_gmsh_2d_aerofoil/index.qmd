    In this tutorial, I will show from end to end how to do a 2d CFD simulation of an aerofoil including the generation of the geometry, the meshing using `gmsh` and the simulation using `OpenFoam`.

# Introduction
The starting point is the [NACA0012 tutorial case in OpenFoam](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/verification-validation-naca0012-airfoil-2d.html). Copy this case to your new working directory. In this tutorial, we will have a look at how to simulate your custom 2d geometry as the tutorial is intransparent about how the mesh was generated.

# Results
```{julia}
using DataFrames,CSV
liftData=CSV.read("case/allResults.dat",DataFrame,header=false)[:,[3,4]]|>Matrix
tangentCoeffs=liftData[:,1]
normalCoeffs=liftData[:,2]
angles=[0.001,5,10,15,20]
using Plots
liftCoeffs=cos.(angles).*normalCoeffs.+sin.(angles).*tangentCoeffs
plot(angles,normalCoeffs)
```
